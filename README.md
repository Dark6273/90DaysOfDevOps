# 90DaysOfDevOps\n\n<p align="center">\n <img src="logo.png?raw=true" alt="90DaysOfDevOps Logo" width="50%" height="50%" />\n</p>\n\nEnglish Version | [中文版本](zh_cn/README.md) | [繁體中文版本](zh_tw/README.md)| [日本語版](ja/README.md) | [Wersja Polska](pl/README.md) | [Tiếng Việt](vi/README.md)\n\nThis repository is used to document my journey on getting a better foundational knowledge of "DevOps". I will be starting this journey on the 1st January 2022 but the idea is that we take 90 days which just so happens to be January 1st to March 31st.\n\nThe reason for documenting these days is so that others can take something from it and also hopefully enhance the resources.\n\nThe goal is to take 90 days, 1 hour each a day, to tackle over 13 areas of "DevOps" to a foundational knowledge.\n\nThis will **not cover all things** "DevOps" but it will cover the areas that I feel will benefit my learning and understanding overall.\n\n[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/N4N33YRCS)\n\nThe quickest way to get in touch is going to be via Twitter, my handle is [@MichaelCade1](https://twitter.com/MichaelCade1)\n\n## Progress\n\n- [❌] ♾️ 1 > [Introduction](Days/day01.md)\n\n### What is and why do we use DevOps\n\n- [❌] ♾️ 2 > [Responsibilities of a DevOps Engineer](Days/day02.md)\n- [❌] ♾️ 3 > [DevOps Lifecycle -
